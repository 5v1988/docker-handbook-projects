# Docker Handbook Projects

![...](./docker-handbook-github.png)

This repository holds the code for my __Docker Handbook__ article on __freeCodecamp__. In the article the readers work through __six__ projects with increasing complexity. These projects are as follows:

- custom-node - A custom node image based on the official [ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/) image.
- custom-bash - A custom bash image based on the official [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) image.
- express-api - A single container Express API.
- vite-counter - A single container Vue application.
- notes-api - A multi container Express API.
- fullstack-notes-application - A full-stack CRUD application with [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) as a reverse proxy.
